# Cars Manager Application

## Overview

This is a simple application for managing cars. It allows users to create car entries with names and costs, search for specific cars, and view a list of cars with options to delete them. The application also displays the total price of all cars, which updates reactively as cars are added, deleted, or searched.

## Features

- **Create Car**: Add new cars with their names and costs.
- **Search Cars**: Filter the list of cars based on user input.
- **List of Cars**: View all added cars with the ability to delete any entry.
- **Total Price**: Automatically updates the total price of all cars as changes are made.

## Technologies Used
